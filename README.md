# ProcessingProjects

This repository contains several different processing projects. All projects with a short description will be listed below.

## Projects
### Growing Circles
This project uses a kind of "circle packing algorithm" to generate and show circles on a canvas. The circles will only be generated on a specific area of the canvas, e.g. the white area of an greyscale image.

### Growing Cirles 2
This project is very similar to _Growing Circles_. The canvas will be filled with multiple circles and the circle color depends on a background image.

### Visualize Downsampled Camera
This project uses a webcam or any other camera, which is connected to the computer and converts the current captured image into a new visualization. The visualization is a downsampled version of the original image, where each brightness value corresponds to a specific rectangle or ellipse size.
This could look like this:

### Conway's Game of Life
This project is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. The following gif way created by my project.

### Particle Swarm
This project creates alot of different sized and colored particles, which follow the mouse movement on the canvas. An additional random particle movement ensures more diversity. Pressing the left mouse button increases the particle speed.

### Analogue Clock
This projects displays a simple analogue clock with daylight indicator.

### Pendulum Wave
Several pendulums with a different length. The length is computed in a way, that leads to a synchronization of all pendulums each "n" periods. In the following gif, you can see a period-time of 10, which means, after 10 periods of the longest pendulum, all pendulums will line up in a straight line again.

### Math Drawing
The coordinates of two points were defined by 4 different equations. Connecting these points results in interesting figures:
