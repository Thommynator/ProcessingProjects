# ProcessingProjects

This repository contains several different processing projects. All projects with a short description will be listed below.

## Projects
### Growing Circles
This project uses a kind of "circle packing algorithm" to generate and show circles on a canvas. The circles will only be generated on a specific area of the canvas, e.g. the white area of an greyscale image.

### Growing Cirles 2
This project is very similar to _Growing Circles_. The canvas will be filled with multiple circles and the circle color depends on a background image.

### Visualize Downsampled Camera
This project uses a webcam or any other camera, which is connected to the computer and converts the current captured image into a new visualization. The visualization is a downsampled version of the original image, where each brightness value corresponds to a specific rectangle or ellipse size.
This could look like this:

### Conway's Game of Life
This project is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. The following gif way created by my project.
