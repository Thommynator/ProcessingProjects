# ProcessingProjects

This repository contains several different processing projects. All projects with a short description will be listed below.

## Projects
### Growing Circles
This project uses a kind of "circle packing algorithm" to generate and show circles on a canvas. The circles will only be generated on a specific area of the canvas, e.g. the white area of an greyscale image.

### Growing Cirles 2
This project is very similar to _Growing Circles_. The canvas will be filled with multiple circles and the circle color depends on a background image.
